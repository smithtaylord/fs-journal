## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
     - User experience is how the user of your app uses and feels while using your app. Making sure that you are thinking of what information the user wants, and not so much what YOU want to show the user. 

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
     - Your users will (or should) feel that your app cares about them, not just what information you are trying to sell them 

3. Why is the User Experience important?
    - If users have a good experience they will want to return to your application.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
    - I made some more progress on this checkpoint today. Leaving today I would pass right now, but would probably not get a duck. There is a lot going on in the project and lots of items to remember. I will try to think of the UX while I am building this out tomorrow.
