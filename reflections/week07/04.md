![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
     - I have been trying to implement better documentation to myself more or less using the TODO and FIXME tags to help reminde me on where I need to fix stuff. 
2. What went well this week?
     - I have felt good about this check point so far. Things have clicked and the front end of this project seems easier than The Network project from last week. 
3. What would you do differently?
     - At this point I would not do anything differently.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
     - I am done! (at least with all of the requirements) I will probably spend some time tonight trying to make my site look as close to the figma as possible.
