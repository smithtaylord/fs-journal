# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


     - I thought this week was going well, but I feel like I kind of embarrassed myself during my grading. I was the most confident turning in the project and although I still got 100% on it, I missed some pretty dumb things. I completely forgot about the UX for a logged out user and they had access on the front end to to many things that they should not have (making comments, attending events). luckily the backend was robust enough to throw errors, but still a bad experience. I am also kicking myself for missing on some of the accessibility requirements.  Overall pleased with my project, but this was a good reminder to stay humble and to make sure to test all aspects of my application. I will take these learnings with me for the capstone project and I will make sure that our project has a great UX for all!
