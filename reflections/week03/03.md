## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
    - Get and Set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
    - The get operator  needs to take in two parameters. 


3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

    - We can use proxies to make the id of certain properties private,
    - We can also use proxies to set at set trap before we set the value if the value does not conform to the validation we can also throw an error.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- Today felt like a step back for me. I am not exactly sure why. I frequently got lost in my files. I think I need to slow down an make sure I am thinking about the connections of where each app lives and remember to code and test small. I think I was rushing myself trying to finish everything by the end of the day when I should have been focusing on doing quality work from the start. I'll get back on it tomorrow!
