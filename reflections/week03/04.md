> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

    - It solves the problem of keeping a bunch of elements synced with changing data, basically makes it so you don's have to call a draw function a thousand times in your code. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
    1. Subscribe Method
    2. Unsubscribe Method
    3. Broadcast method. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
     - It merges both concepts in the "listener function" with the appState.on. Under the hood it is using the observer pattern as well as using a get operations with two keys (what it is listening for as well as what function it will run.)

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

 - Today was much better than yesterday. During lab I spent more time navigating than driving, which was really good for me. While I was navigating Jonah a lot clicked for me, I think having to say out loud what path we needed to take helped solidify the MVC pattern. I am going to have to remember to take it slow and not try to rush my self, because that is where I get in trouble.
