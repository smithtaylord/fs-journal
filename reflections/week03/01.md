Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment.
     - Oooof today was rough. I think I am starting to get the very basics of the MVCSS architecture, but it will take some time and practice to get the hang of it. It feels like I have taken a step back from Friday, but Hopefully by this upcoming Friday I am feeling like I have taken 3 steps forward.
