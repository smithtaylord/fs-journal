## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
    - I really liked the tip on reducing the opacity of white text on a colored background rather than using a light grey. This makes so much sense, but something I don't think I would think of off the top of my head. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
 - Use text weight over text size
 - Use fewer borders, use box-shadows, other colors or extra space instead
 - Use colors to accent!
 - Think of the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary functions of the site and use buttons and colors to help get that point across
3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
 - This article really made me think about conveying the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary functions of a site. And good design will help the user understand these things without really having to think about them. Super Cool!

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
 - Bootstrap did make CSS easier and it made the CSS style sheet much easier to read, but CSS is still pretty finikey, and learning bootstrap I think is going to have its ups and downs. There is so much information and at this point I am still unsure of what it can and cannot do. I am excited to continue to see what the full capabilities of CSS and bootstrap are. 
 - Second thing, I thought this exercise was pretty fun! It did take me a while, but time flew by while I was working.
