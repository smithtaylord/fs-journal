## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
 - This helps focus the direction of a site or application before a developer starts developing the site. This will get the designer and developer on the same page.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
- Low, Mid, and High fidelity. 
- Low is simple sketches and only takes a few minutes
- Mid takes a little more effort, but uses a simple program and dummy images and text
- High will look as close to an actual website as possible getting real images and text. Takes more time but is very clear of the directions

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
 - I would say that they are, The time and effort in planning will make the project run more smoothly, rather than guessing and checking later, then you might have to re-do a bunch of work.
