## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
    - This is a way to show off your skills to a potential employer.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
    - It will help you stand out from the competition and is a way to show off your skills. 

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
    - I have felt proud of all of my projects so far. I would probably include my tower project and The Network on my Portfolio, but I could also see myself trying to expand on these projects a little further to help me stick out from my classmates.
