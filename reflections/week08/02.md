## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
    - Communication on a small team is so important because it is what will keep everyone on track and working on the right processes. Without effective communication a small team could easily become disorganized and the end result will suffer.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
    - The largest difference is that they reduced the amount of meeting, or turned those meetings into quick slack messages. They still had to communicate effectively, but reducing the amount of in person meetings took some distractions away. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
    - GOOD service CHEAP wont be FAST
    - GOOD service FAST wont be CHEAP
    - FAST service CHEAP wont be GOOD

    - These all have their benefits, it just depends on what the client is wanting. At the end of the day these are really the three main variables a business has. It is up to them to choose how they spend their money, what quality product they want to produce, and how fast they want to move.
