## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
    - Unit Testing - This allows you to test individual units of code
    - Component Testing - This method tests to make sure your components are working
    - E2E Testing - This tests what happens when a user actually uses your site

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
     - I think that the E2E testing would be the most useful due to the fact that the end user is what we are trying to build our website or application for, if you cannot pass these tests you ultimately will not have a great product.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
    - I think that all of these methods have their reasons, but the one that I feel like would be the least important is the component testing, because I feel like if your application is working and passing the other tests it should also pass these component tests.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
     - Today was a little more of a struggle with the project. As a team we realized that we did most of the easy tasks yesterday and today had to deal with some more complex issues. As the code is getting more complex it has been harder to debug the code, especially code that someone else has written.
