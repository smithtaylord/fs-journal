# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

     - I think overall we had a great week and our project turned out better than expexted. Some of our team seemed to hit a wall around lunch time and our willingness to hit some of our strech goals seemed to decline quickly, but overall the project went well. One big shock/surprize that I found throughout this project that is that I feel like I have a knack for breaking down code to find bugs. I don't feel super comfortable saying this out loud, but I'll say it any way, I feel like the code I usually write myself generally works, or I can get it working quickly, but when I am helping out a team mate I frequently had to break it down into every little chunk of code, but in doing that it helped solidify some concepts and how data is processed. Right now I don't feel like I am struggling with anything!
