## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
    - We are using most of the same technologies and principles that were used in the tower project. We are using both the NYT Books API as well as GoogleBooksAPI. The project has lots of many to many relationships.         

2. What went well so far?
    - So far our team has done a great job of working together and trying to solve problems. I think we are all hard workers and want to produce a good product at the end. Part of our team veered a little off course on Wednesday and started to work on some tasks that were not in out MVP, but after a quick group meeting we made sure that we stuck with our plan. We spent two days planning and wanted to make sure that those days were not wasted   

3. What would you do differently? Why?
    - I think the one thing I would want to do differently is taking a little more time at the begginging when our earliest models and functions were being made. There are a handful of items that I feel like we should had handeled differently, or that I would have done a different way on a project of my own, and by the time I noticed it seemed like it would have been too hard to change, only to find out later on that if it were done the way I was thinking it would have made some other things easier
