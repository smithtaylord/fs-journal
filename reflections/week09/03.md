## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
- It is an image file that has been encoded into a string of text

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
     - CPU overhead, Caching Issues, SEO and User Experience
3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
        - The biggesting thing I can see is that it is harmful to the users experience, if the images take longer to load that is not a great quality of the website. If images take along time to load and cannot cache the user will be frusterated.
