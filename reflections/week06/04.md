## Questions

1. What is a nested route?
    - This is when you "nest" a child route within a parent route. For example website.come/learning/internet. The '/internet' would be the rested route. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
    - You would want to use a nested route when you are digging deeper into a pager, or a certain section of your website. It is just a file structure, so if you have a broad section (that would be the parent)and then the more specific nested route would be the child.  

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
    - You can pass parameters thought nested routes, you would use this when you are searching for something by its Id, that would be put on a parameter.
