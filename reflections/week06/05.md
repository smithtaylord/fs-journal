# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

    - WOW what a week! Vue has so many tools to use and I think as I am finally writing this on Sunday night I am realizing how little I know (not in a bad way). Using vue makes so many things easier especially abstracting parts of your code out. I do need to remember to use all of its functionally right off the bat. I noticed that I would do things my old way, and after I had copied the same code two or three times went. AH! I should abstract this out into a component. This checkpoint was the most difficult one yet, but I am feeling good about it now that I am done!
