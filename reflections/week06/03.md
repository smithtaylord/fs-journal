## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
    - Lifestyle hooks are a glimps behind the scenes of how the library you are using works. Lifestyle hooks are used for letting you know when your components are created, added to the DOM, updated, or deleted. 

    - Lifestyle hooks act as an event listener of sorts that will allow you to quickly and easily write code that happens before or after some certain events

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
     - I think we have only really used mounted, but I can see the value in using a created, you can use this to set data defaults(maybe this was already happening), We may have also done a lo-fi version of this when we clear our data from the screen, maybe this could be an area where we could call one of these lifestyle hooks to clean that up for us.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
     - I believe that these are our "event listeners" they will listen for changes and then update the screen accordingly.
