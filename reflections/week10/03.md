    description VARCHAR(255)
)defauly charset utf8 COMMENT '';

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
    - I am starting to get the hang of this C# and SQL thing, but I am finding it hard to go back to not knowing how to fix my mistakes, with javascript I was pretty comfortable with error handeling, but I am finding my self going up to the TA table for lots of little mistakes. I need to be more careful, but I think after staring this project lots of things are clicking more and I am not just copying the reference.
