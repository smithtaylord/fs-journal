## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
    - An Enum is a type that allows you to assign a symbolic name to an integral value.

    They are used to set a strongly typed constansts via a symbolic name. Like North, South, East, and West are east to ready, but the program will see them as 0,1,2,and 3 

2. How can you modify an Enum?
    -You can change its default from an int, you can also change the first value in the enum from zero to any other number if you like. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
    - I have not used an enum in Csharp yet, I think I could give it a go in the ALL SPICE application for the types of recipe!

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
