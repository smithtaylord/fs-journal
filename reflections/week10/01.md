## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
    1. Value Type - This type holds a data value within its own memory space
    2. Reference Type - This does not store its value directly, instead it stores the address where the value is being stored.
    3. Pointer Type - This represents a memory address that allows you to manipulate memory directly. 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript? 

    - There are a bunch! bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort.

    - The biggest difference is that there are many more and they seem to be way more strict. Also it is interesting that undefined, null, Nan do not exist either. 



3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
    - These are just references and are not the actual object, similar to how we use computed and the appstate in vue. It can see and use the value, but it cannot change the value

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
    - The biggest thing I found out is that C# is picky about everything, but the nice thing is that generally if the intellisense is not not mad at you your code should work. I got the lab done heavily using the reference, and do not feel like much has stuck, but with a few more days hopefully I'll be able to rely on the references less and less.
