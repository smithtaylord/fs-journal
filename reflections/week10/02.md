Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
     - Today's takeaway is similar to yesterday's. Everything is very particular which can be a little frusterating at time, but I am starting to feel a little better, I was at the TA table today more often than I have been for a while and they have been for little things. I need to remember to link my files correctly as well as watching my syntax.
