# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- This week was overall good, starting to learn CSharp and SQL had its challenges, but I like learning. I think the biggest shock is that my ability to trouble shoot somehow completely disapeared until Thursday, I was really getting into trouble with connecting documents and missing semi:colons. At the moment I don't think I am struggling too much with anything, I think it would just be the troubleshooting with the backend and postman tests.
