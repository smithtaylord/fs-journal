> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
    - Deeply nested code that has multiple functions within it. It will cause your code to not be read easily and trouble shooting will be very difficult. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
     - Asynchronous means that the code will not run in order, basically your code will get to this point, start the process of its request and then move on, once it has done the async function there will be a call back that says "I am ready now" and it will finish running the code. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
    - Don't nest your functions
    - Make and keep your code in modules
    - handle all of your errors

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
