# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- This was a good week. I grasped the concepts quickly and did not run into many road blocks. I have been using lots of references and not necessarily memorizing all of the steps, but I always know where to look to find the right answer. The checkpoint this week has been fun and I am aiming at hitting lots of the strech goals.
