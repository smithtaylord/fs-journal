Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
    - Today's lab felt good. I was a good tip to learn that you can put an entire URL into axios.create variable. I did have a few errors pop up today, but nothing I could not figure out. I think error handling and debugging will be the biggest challenges going forward, but I am feeling pretty good with where I am at for now.
