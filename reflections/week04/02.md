## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
    - Pending
    - Resolved
    - Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
     - They do this by chaining. It is much easier to read when this is done rather than just nesting multiple callback functions within each other.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

    - Then is for resolved promises and Catch is for rejected promises. If it has been resolved THEN run this code... if it has been rejected CATCH it here and throw and error.
