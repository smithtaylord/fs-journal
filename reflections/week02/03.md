## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    - console.log() will write information to the console for you to test your code out and also can be a way to debug your code. 
    - you can also directly write into the console from the dev tools as another way to test out your code.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    - The elements Tab holds the HTML and CSS information. This tab is useful when debugging code because this is where you will see what changes you have made with javascript and it will affect the DOM directly.


3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    - Using Break Points is another way to debug your code. You can have your code stop at a certain point and you can go line by line at your own pace to make sure everything is running properly.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
    - My Biggest take away from today's Lab work is to bite off small chunks and make lists! The tips from class helped out on the lab a bunch, but I think having the time to formulate my thoughts before actually coding helped my brain process much faster.
