# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
     - This week was a nice confidence boost, I was able to get the checkpoint done quickly and did not really get hung up on any one part of it, no T.A. help needed 
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    - No real shocks or surprises this week.
- What are you struggling with?
    - The only struggle this week was with our partner lab, I felt a little bad that I was driving most of the time since Thomas was a little lost. I want to make it a priority next Thursday to work on letting the other person drive even if what they are saying is wrong. 
- What would you count as a victory?
     - Finishing all of the checkpoint requirements before leaving on Friday!
