## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

    - It helps get you thinking of the big picture and thinking of where and how your code should be connected to each other. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    - Google is a great place to start! But you need to be careful not to just copy and paste from google, make sure that you know what the code is doing before putting it into your project. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

    - Less is usually more
    - Plan, but do not over-plan
    - Spend the time to make your code clean and organized
    - Use Comments, but don't use comments where you could have just used more descriptive names.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
 - Today's assignment went well, it helped me practice the flow of starting and setting up a project. It was also another good reminder to keep code organized with lots of comments. Working with Thomas was a little bit of a struggle since he wanted to deviate from our "plan" often, but was a good reminder as to why it is important to make a plan and stick with it :) The fire side was helpful as well, and seeing Savannah's code was cool too see her form of organization.
