## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
    - function declaration is a function that has a name and is hoisted (can be used anywhere in your code)
    - a function expression is an anonymous, these can be named or anonymous, these are not hoisted
    - Arrow function expressions is just a short hand version of function declaration
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
    - parameters are what you put in the function when you write them(I am thinking of them as placeholders)
    - Arguments are what you run through the function when your code runs. 
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
    - A higher order function takes in or returns another function. .filter and .find are both higher order functions.
