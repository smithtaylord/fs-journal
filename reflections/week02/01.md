## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
 - Scope is basically where you would be able to use that variable. Global means anywhere in that file and locally scoped means that it would be only available within that function. 
2. What is Hoisting ?
 - hoisting is a property of the VAR variable declaration where it will "hoist" that variable to the top of the page and will not necessarily read this in top down order. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
 - let Should be used as the default, let allows for the variable to be changed later on
 - const is used when you want the variable to stay constant
 - var should not be used, it will work, but it has a bunch of hidden downfalls and can sometime make your code run incorrectly.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
 - Today was a good first day of learning the basics of JavaScript. Doing Moody kittens has helped me understand today's information quite well and I was able to finish the Lab work relatively quickly and spent quite a bit of time working on styling. I did have to google how to getElementById, but I think within time that will become second nature.
