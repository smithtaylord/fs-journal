# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

     - This week was something new with us learning node and the backend. I found it fairly easy to pick up I think due to the repetitive nature, but I found out quickly that in the repitition it is easy to make one little mistake that is difficult to find. The victory for this week was the hackathon project. We got what we wanted done done, as the night went on it was more difficult to stay focused, but we did it!
