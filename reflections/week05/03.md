## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
    - It is a planning mythology that gives you many small deadlines within the day. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
    - Doing my most dreaded tasks early in the day, If I do not finish a deadline, don't give up, set a new deadline, and try to shorten the amount of time that I think I need to finish a task. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
    - Sometimes when I am doing my journals at home if I am not feeling it that night I will put it off until the next night, or if the article is long I will dilly dally around rather than just finishing it up for the night so I can be done for the day.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- There is alot going on with today's lab, I was able to get through everything, but in hindsight, I don't think I was thinking through the project the right way, I had it where you would load all of the planets, colonies etc. I also was not really doing any data validation. I should probably ask about that just to be sure.
