## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?
    - A virtual property is an additional field on a model that shows the relationship to somthing else.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 
    - The article gave the example of using one to concatinate a first and last name to create a "full name" We have used them in class to show a relationship to another area of our database.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?
    - This new information comes as another key:value pair on your object so you would have to search for that on your original object and then drill into it with dot notation.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
 - Since there was no real assignment today This is my takeaway from the hackathon. It was pretty fun, and I think we had a great plan of rotating positions frequently. In hindsight It would have been better to have a better plan of attack early on and to fully utelize our trello board.
