## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
- A Primary Key is the main identifier on a table, a foreign key is a reference to the table that is being joined on that key.  

2. What is an `Alias`?
 - This is how we rename items in a table this way it can be easier to read, say if both tables had a "name" you can add on so your naming is less confusing.


3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

SELECT 
*
FROM doctors d 
JOIN doctors ON d.doctorsId = d.id
JOIN patients p ON p.id = d.patientId
WHERE d.id == the doctors id
