## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

    - I am very proud of where I am at in this course, was it difficult, yes. But after the first few weeks I felt like I really got back into the learning mentality, and I was a much better student than when I was in college (over 10 years ago). I think the biggest take away I have from this course is that this is something that I am good at, but I need to remember to stay humble (which usually is not an issue for me). There have been a few times where I feel like I have been overly confident and then was kicked down the stairs a little bit.  

    - As for the final, I am feeling confident, I am anxious to receive it, but I don't feel overly stressed out. I know many of my peers are, but at for me I am excited to prove myself that I can do this and that I have all the tools I need to finish. I am really aiming to finish early so I can spend some time this next week working on career services items, a portfolio site, and interview prep. 

    - I think what I have enjoyed the most from this experience is seeing how excited I am to work on these projects and how I can sit down for hours on end and just work and not get distracted with my thoughts. It is a really good feeling. It reminds me of when I used to write music for the drumline where I could sit down and write music for hours and hours on end with out taking a break becuase it was something I enjoyed. In many ways coding is very similar to writing music, it is a puzzle in a sense that needs solving. I am excited to see where I wind up working and this feels like a great step to the next chapter of my life.
