# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
let const and var, but we never use var
```
**2.** What is the definition of a function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A function is a "program" within your code that does a specific thing (what ever the user programed it to do. )
```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
object orented Design 

Single Responsibility Principle
Open-Close Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle
Interface Segregation Principle
Dependency Inversion Principle
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
[2] the arrays position starts at [0] and then counts up from there
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
you.friends.push(them)
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
if (this thing) {
  Do this code here!
}
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
you would put i++ for it to increase by one, and it is called the iteration
```
**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Document Object Model
```

**9.** What are the `9` ECMAScript types as defined by MDN?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Numbers, Strings, Bools, Array, Object, Function, undefined, null, NaN 
```
**10.** When it comes to functions or methods, what is the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A parameter is what is written into the function in the () and it will be reusable part of the code, the argument is what is supplied once the code runs. 
```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A primitive value is once that cannot be changed ever! and a reference is one that can be changed.
